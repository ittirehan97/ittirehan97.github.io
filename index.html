      <h3>Romance</h3>
      <p>it's easy to find a variety of works that might be classified as 'romance.' Many of them, of course, focus on some aspect of romantic (and sometimes erotic) love, which is what most readers would associate with the genre today. However, even modern Harlequin paperbacks and more religious romantic stories continue to have readers expect the unexpected, from fortuitous twists of fate to the most improbable instances of happenstance.</p>
