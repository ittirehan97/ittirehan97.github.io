      <h1>Fantasy</h1>
      <h2>Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often (but not always) without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Its roots are in oral traditions, which then developed into literature and drama. From the twentieth century it has expanded further into various media, including film, television, graphic novels, and video games.</h2>
